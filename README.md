# Overview

Apache Fineract (\’fīn-,ә-,rakt\) is open source software for financial services.

Fineract provides a reliable, robust, and affordable solution for entrepreneurs, financial institutions, and service providers to offer financial services to the world’s 2 billion underbanked and unbanked. Fineract is aimed at innovative mobile and cloud-based solutions, and enables digital transaction accounts for all.

Fineract 1.x compares well to other core banking systems and draws from requirements in credit unions, microfinance institutions, and small non-banking financial institutions. Features include flexible product configuration, KYC documentation support, business rule sets, payment transactions, and portfolio management. It includes an open API that dates to 2011 and is deployed in relatively high transaction volume environments.
